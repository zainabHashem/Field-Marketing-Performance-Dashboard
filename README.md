This is my Field Marketing Performance Dashboard.
I built two versions: one in Excel and one in Power BI — to demonstrate both manual data handling and automated visualization skills.
The goal is to analyze promoters’ performance, regional sales, and store distribution to support marketing decisions.


Excel Dashboard

This Excel dashboard was designed to track key performance metrics of field marketing.
It includes revenue, promoters, promo types, and store distribution.
I used charts, slicers, and data-driven visualizations for better interactivity.

KPIs at the top:
Total Revenue (7M)
Total Visits (1500)
Avg Audit Score (3.03)
Total Promoters (1200)

Revenue by Month / Region / Promo Type
Cairo has the highest revenue, showing strong sales performance in that region
Number of Promoters & Hours Worked by Region -> (productivity indicator)
Top 10 Promoters by Visits -> (useful for rewards or best-practice analysis)
Store Distribution & Status
Low Stock Products  -> (Helps make quick resupply decisions)
So in Excel, I focused on a clean, functional dashboard using slicers and visual consistency for decision-makers


Power BI Dashboard

In Power BI, I recreated and enhanced the dashboard for automation and interactivity.
KPIs cards on top:
Summarized same metrics dynamically (linked to data model).
Visuals used:
Bar charts for regional analysis
Pie chart for promo type revenue
Line chart for revenue trends over time
Donut chart for store status
Horizontal bar chart for promoter count
Filters (Slicers):
Interactive filters by Region & Promo Type allow management to drill down quickly.
Design:
Clean theme with corporate-style colors and alignment.
Consistent formatting and readable numbers (in millions).
In Power BI, I used DAX measures for total revenue and average audit score, added slicers for interactivity, and ensured responsiveness in layout.
